### Getting started

You can initialize a new GFlow project with this command:

```bash
gflow init
```

This command will configure the production and development branches.


### Configuration options

Gflow init command generate a `.glfowrc` config file with some options look like:

```json
{
  "production": "production",
  "develop": "master",
  "charBranchNameSeparator": "_",
  "remote": "origin",
  "ignores": [],
  "syncAfterFinish": true,
  "postFinish": "",
  "skipTest": true,
  "branchTypes": {
    "feat": "feat",
    "fix": "fix",
    "chore": "chore",
    "docs": "docs"
  }
}
```

Key | Description
---|---
`production` | Name of the production branch or the branch use as reference to rebase a feature branch.
`develop` | Name of the development branch (or the release candidate branch).
`charBranchNameSeparator` | Char separator of the a branch between branchName and task type (feat, fix, chore, etc...). Example: if char = "/" `feat/branch_name`.
`remote` | Alias name of the remote repository (origin).
`ignores` | Disable rebasing for the given branch list when the `rebase-all` command is used.
`syncAfterFinish`Â | Perform synchronization between `production` and `develop` branches.
`postFinish` | Run command after the `finish` command.
`skipTest` | Disable unit test step.
`branchTypes` | Configure the branch types for the command `gflow new`.


## Use travis and semantic release

Gflow is compliante with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and provide
plugin for this.


To begin generate your semantic-release configuration with [semantic-release-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release-cli)
then create `release.config.js` and add these lines:

```json
module.exports = {
  branch: 'production',
  plugins: [
    '@semantic-release/commit-analyzer',
    '@semantic-release/release-notes-generator',
    '@semantic-release/npm',
    '@gflow/src/command/release'
  ]
};
```
